## About Me 

Hi there, I'm Anne! ðŸ‘‹  

Prior to software engineering, I worked in education equity and politics. 

For three years, I worked on the customer support/community management team at a mission-driven edtech startup called [Magoosh](https://magoosh.com.). In 2018, I pivoted to politics and worked on both local and national campaigns. Most recently, I was on the data team for President Bidenâ€™s campaign in Florida, where I built reporting tools for our field program. It was during my completely remote experience on Biden that I saw how impactful well designed digital tools could be for furthering a cause, and that led me to programming and my interest in building software for mission-driven organizations. I graduated Hackbright Academy's full-stack software engineering program in July 2021 and am currently looking for full-time roles in political tech / civic tech / tech for good.

âš¡  Fun fact: Before she was our first female Vice President, Kamala Harris was running for President! I was hired as one of VP Harris' first field organizers for her Iowa team in 2019 (see pic above for the Iowa team in front of her bus!)
